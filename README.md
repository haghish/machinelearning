> __CITE: Haghish, E. F. (in preparation). Integrating R machine learning algorithms in Stata using rcall 3.0: a tutorial for Stata developers__

Description
-----------

The `machinelearning` package is a Stata module including several R machine learning (ML) algorithms, implemented in 
Stata using [`rcall`](https://github.com/haghish/rcall) package. The reason for developing this package is twofold:

- Bringing several machine learning R packages to Stata and making them available to the community
- Provide a simplistic tutorial and a real-world example showing how to 
  + embed intricate R code into Stata _Ado programs_ 
  + document Stata _Ado programs_ with Markdown language using [`MarkDoc`](https://github.com/haghish/markdoc) literate programming package 
  + build Stata package using [`MarkDoc`](https://github.com/haghish/markdoc)

Therefore, while the majority of users will install this package to use the machine learning algorithms, advanced Stata 
users are invited to read the code and see how the documentation is implemented within the Stata code.
